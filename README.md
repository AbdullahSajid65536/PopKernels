# PopKernels
A small minigame made in C to experiment with POSIX threads, atomic operations, signal handling and numerical methods. The game itself is straightforward, choose a popcorn bag size and a microwave timer. pop=win, not pop=lose, burn=mega lose. You may also cancel the timer to end the game for a small penalty. Check ReadME for more info.
